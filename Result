Model selection is an important factor in predicting satisfactory results. Out of ARIMA and LSTM, LSTM yields better data-fitting and overfitting in long term modelling. In different random training of the model, it was found 84-87% of reduction in error rates while data-fitting as compared to ARIMA model claiming the superiority of LSTM over ARIMA in long term modelling. While predicting, LSTM modelling has the advantage of better error handling when it comes to presence of huge deviation in seasonal dataset. The reason is the possibility of learning noisy and nonlinear relationships with every step and explicit handling of ordered observations by adapting itself.
But, ARIMA/SARIMAX model out-performs machine learning and deep learning methods in both one-step and multi-step forecasting on univariate datasets given that there shouldn't be much errors and deviations other than the seasonality itself.
